            <p>
                I'm a Computer Science senior at the University of Central Florida. After
                graduating in August of 2023, I want to be a Software Engineer. I am interested
                in backend and fullstack technologies, but am always open to taking on new
                challenges. I love learning how things work, and putting my problem solving skills
                to use so I can make the world a better place one line of code at a time.
